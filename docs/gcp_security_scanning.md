# Google Cloud Security Scanning

This document provides an overview of Google Cloud's native container security scanning capabilities and recommendations for their use in the `sbcwaste` project.

## Artifact Analysis

**Artifact Analysis** is a service that provides vulnerability scanning for container images stored in Google Artifact Registry or Container Registry.

### Key Features

*   **Automated Scanning:** Automatically scans new images when they are pushed to the registry.
*   **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in OS packages and application dependencies.
*   **Integration:** Integrates with Cloud Build and other CI/CD tools to automate security checks.
*   **Reporting:** Provides detailed reports on found vulnerabilities, including severity levels and remediation advice.

### Recommendations for `sbcwaste`

*   **Enable Artifact Analysis:** Enable Artifact Analysis on the Artifact Registry repository where the `sbcwaste` container images are stored.
*   **Automate Scanning:** Configure scanning to be triggered automatically on every image push.
*   **Integrate with CI/CD:** Integrate the scanning results into the CI/CD pipeline. For example, you could add a step to the GitHub Actions workflow that fails the build if any high-severity vulnerabilities are found.
*   **Replace Trivy:** Since Artifact Analysis provides similar functionality to Trivy, you could consider replacing the Trivy scan in the CI/CD pipeline with the results from Artifact Analysis. This would simplify the workflow and rely on a managed service for vulnerability scanning.

## Container Threat Detection

**Container Threat Detection** is a runtime security service that detects common container attacks.

### Key Features

*   **Runtime Protection:** Monitors running containers for suspicious activity, such as the execution of malicious binaries or reverse shells.
*   **Real-time Alerts:** Generates real-time alerts in Security Command Center and Cloud Logging when a threat is detected.
*   **Managed Service:** As a managed service, it requires minimal configuration and maintenance.

### Recommendations for `sbcwaste`

*   **Enable Container Threat Detection:** Enable Container Threat Detection for the Cloud Run service where the `sbcwaste` application is deployed.
*   **Monitor Alerts:** Monitor the alerts generated by Container Threat Detection in Security Command Center.
*   **Complementary to Static Analysis:** Use Container Threat Detection as a complementary security measure to the static analysis provided by Artifact Analysis and `gosec`. While static analysis can identify vulnerabilities before deployment, runtime protection can help detect and respond to attacks that were not caught by the static analysis.

## Conclusion

Google Cloud provides a comprehensive set of tools for container security. By using Artifact Analysis and Container Threat Detection, you can significantly improve the security posture of the `sbcwaste` application. It is recommended to enable both services and integrate them into the existing CI/CD workflow.
